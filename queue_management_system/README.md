# bank-queue-service
Bank-Queue-Service is a lightweight backend for bank branch queueing and ticketing. Admins configure service types and desks; customers open tickets without authentication; operators manage the flow (call next, start, finish, cancel). A public monitor endpoint shows the live queue to reduce wait times and organize traffic.
